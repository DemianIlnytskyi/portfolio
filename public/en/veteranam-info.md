## **Challenge**
The goal was to create an accessible, user-friendly app that would centralize discounts and offers for war veterans in Ukraine. The app needed to prioritize ease of use and inclusivity, ensuring that veterans could easily navigate and access relevant deals. Additionally, a dedicated platform was required for businesses to independently manage and add their discount offerings.

## **Solution**
Using **Flutter**, we developed a cross-platform solution, including both a **mobile app** for Android and iOS and a **web version**. The design focused on inclusiveness and simplicity, ensuring veterans of varying tech skills could easily use the app. Additionally, we created a **business office** where representatives from participating businesses can independently add and manage their offers, streamlining the process for both veterans and service providers.

Businesses also benefited by gaining a direct, user-friendly way to support veterans, managing their offerings independently, and increasing engagement with the veteran community. The app fostered a stronger connection between veterans and businesses, enhancing support within the community.
