## **Challenge**
The project aimed to develop a dynamic mobile application for food trucks, requiring comprehensive features for managing truck information, item listings, location-based services, distinct user experiences, and integrated payment processing to facilitate seamless interactions between vendors and customers.

## **Solution**
As a freelance developer for an agency, I contributed to the **Hunger Quest** project using **FlutterFlow**, focusing on building and enhancing various key functionalities. My work included implementing features for adding and editing truck information, efficiently loading and displaying menu items from Firebase in a list view, and integrating Google Maps for intuitive location selection. I also developed support for two distinct user roles, each with tailored access and behavior, and integrated RevenueCat for robust payment processing, including the implementation of a user trial period.

## **Result**
The **Hunger Quest** application successfully became a comprehensive platform connecting food trucks with users. The implemented features streamlined truck management, simplified item Browse, and enabled precise location-based interactions. The support for diverse user roles and a seamless payment system, complete with trial periods, enhanced the overall user experience and facilitated efficient monetization for vendors.
