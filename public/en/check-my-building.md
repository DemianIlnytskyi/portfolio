## **Challenge**  
The business needed a streamlined solution to replace complex, email-based audit reports and improve the efficiency of house inspections, which were previously time-consuming and lacked a cohesive system for tracking progress and responsibilities.

## **Solution**  
We developed **Check My Building**, a user-friendly mobile application built with **Flutter**, designed to simplify audit processes. Key features include photo-based visual confirmations, real-time status updates, and item-specific comments. Additionally, we integrated functionality for planning audits, assigning responsible team members, and creating custom templates for new audits. To enhance usability, we carefully designed the user path and conducted rigorous testing to ensure a seamless experience.

## **Result**  
By transitioning from email reports to a dedicated app, the business significantly boosted audit efficiency and accountability. The streamlined audit process allowed for faster, regular submission of reports, accurate tracking of audit status, and reduced administrative load, ultimately saving time and improving operational clarity.
