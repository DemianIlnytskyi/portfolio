            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">This is some example content illustrating how the cookie
                dialog and the top component coexist without hiding each other. Since there's no JavaScript, the cookie
                dialog is part of the normal document flow but uses <code>position: sticky</code> to remain visible at
                the top when you scroll down.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
                cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa
                qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Scroll down to observe that the content is pushed down naturally,
                ensuring the cookie dialog is fully visible and does not obscure your main header. When you scroll, the
                cookie dialog will stick to the top of the viewport.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Here is some additional text to make the page content longer.
                This helps in demonstrating the scrolling behavior and confirming that the sticky cookie dialog does not
                overlap with your main website header or navigation. The natural document flow, combined with
                <code>position: sticky</code>, ensures all your content remains fully visible and accessible.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">As you scroll, notice how the cookie dialog initially pushes
                the header down, and then sticks to the very top of the viewport. This separation ensures a clean user
                experience where important information like navigation is never obscured by the cookie consent banner.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">You can add even more paragraphs here to fill out the page and
                test the scrolling behavior extensively. This setup is highly responsive, meaning the cookie dialog will
                adjust its height based on its content, and the page content will adapt accordingly, whether viewed on a
                desktop, tablet, or mobile device.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">This is a significant amount of text. Please continue
                scrolling to ensure the behavior of the sticky cookie dialog is as expected. This method offers a pure
                CSS solution to prevent overlapping, though it does not handle cookie acceptance persistence.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Another paragraph to really stretch the page out. We want to
                be absolutely sure that the sticky banner correctly interacts with the rest of the page's flow and its
                sticking mechanism. The design remains clean and user-friendly, adapting well to various screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Final thoughts on the pure CSS approach: it simplifies
                development by removing the need for JavaScript, but trades off dynamic hiding and user preference
                persistence. For many simple sites, this trade-off might be acceptable.</p>
